As a collaborative community, we believe in documenting and sharing our insights with other news nerds. You can see some of our inspiration below.

Here are the documentation efforts we've undertaken so far:

- [**A Field Guide to Media Tech + Product**](/resources/field-guide)
- [**Best Practices for News Sites**](/resources/best-practices)
- [**JavaScript template rigs**](/resources/template-rigs)
- [**List of Journalism/Tech Conferences**](/resources/conferences)
